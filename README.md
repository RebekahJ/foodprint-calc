> Compare carbon foodprint of various custom diet plans

## TODO
+ Get data needed
+	a) co2 per kg(?) of foods
+	b) recipes (20 main, 20 lunch, 10 breakfast, 20 snacks, drinks?) and quantities
+ decide best system to store info so calculations will work
+ language? If purely personal then c++ works for me in XCode, although how to select diet combo without writing input file, or ~35 command line inputs? Javascript may be better for interactive, web interface system?

## Issues
- do for my portion sizes for now?
- seasonal/geography issues? i.e. include food miles or just focus on production emissions? Would make big difference to e.g. [rice](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rice#Production), [sugar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugarcane#Production)…, and add dependence on user location. Do for UK user for now…
