> Compare carbon foodprint of various custom diet plans

## Design plan
+ Two modes for 2 different levels of detail: 
+ 	a) Fine detail: Drag and drop ingredients from categorized menus on left onto empty plate icons on right. Name each plate. Add quantities to each ingredient. Can line up plates an compare emissions and nutritional values.
+ 	b) Bigger scale: Pre-designed meals with calculated emissions/values on left. Drag plates into meal calendar / table to create weekly diets with total emissions/values displayed. Can create different diets (with different names) to compare effect of e.g. removing red meat, removing dairy etc.


## Sources of data
+ [EWG Meat Eater’s Guide](http://static.ewg.org/reports/2011/meateaters/pdf/methodology_ewg_meat_eaters_guide_to_health_and_climate_2011.pdf) UK values.
+ [USDA](http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/)


## Complications and subtleties to resolve
+ Portion sizes: for pre-designed meals, decide a standard portion size. Shouldn’t matter as long as size consistent as comparison is the aim.
+ Seasonal and location issues: Emissions associated with food types can be divided into production related and transport/storage related. Foods which can only be grown/produced in certain regions, or grow seasonally, will be flown in to others. This will make foodprints location and season dependent. Accounting for this would be ideal, but initially options are a) get production data only b) get data for one, consistent location (with the aim to allow location to be selected if data sets for different countries can be found). Later, either average transport-related emissions over a year to allow for standard changes in food sources with the seasons, or (data allowing) give option to select time of year and global or local only, to reflect shopping habits, where ingredients will disappear from the list should they not be available within the chosen radius from location.
