> Compare carbon foodprint of various custom diet plans

## TODO
+ Get data needed
+	a) co2 per kg(?) of foods
+	b) recipes (20 main, 20 lunch, 10 breakfast, 20 snacks, drinks?) and quantities
+ decide best system to store info so calculations will work
+ language? If purely personal then c++ works for me in XCode, although how to select diet combo without writing input file, or ~35 command line inputs? Javascript may be better for interactive, web interface system?

+ [Food groups](http://fivepercent.us/2008/05/29/link-relative-climate-impact-of-red-meat-vs-other-food-types/)

## Issues
- do for my portion sizes for now?
- seasonal issues? i.e. include food miles or just focus on production?
