## TODO
####Short
+ Get some comparison emissions info. Display result in kg + equivalent activities e.g. 60W bulb burning for x mins, x mile car journey, hours of tv, boiled kettlesâ€¦
+ With calories, give % of daily requirements for an average adult man/woman (needed to compare nutritional value of different meals to evaluate quality of diet). (Later extension - protein? Carbs? Important nutritional groups rather than just calories?).
+ Add remove/edit buttons next to ingredients in the recipe list.
+ Change prompt when same ingredient is selected more than once.


####Long
+ Separate data array and prompt for liquids with quantities in ml? (Currently rely on people converting to g).
+ Add form to take recipe name
+ Need a more comprehensive list of foods, and consistent data set e.g. transport etc left out, or all data corresponding to the same country/region. Additional data needed:
+	a) co2 and cals per kg of foods for LOTS more ingredients
+	b) recipes (20 main, 20 lunch, 10 breakfast, 20 snacks, drinks?) and quantities
+ Add tabs for the 2 modes - meal detail and week/month detail
+ Design - look into drag and drop methods for ingredients, test. Need food and plate icons.
+ Decide best system to store info so calculations will work - separate into food groups to make searches faster? Would speed up array searches (when ingredient choice is longer) but need to include method to tell function which food arrays to search based on recipe contents.
+ Improve design. Make scrolling single page?
