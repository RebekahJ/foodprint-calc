## TODO
####Short
+ Get some comparison emissions info. Display result in kg + equivalent activities e.g. 60W bulb burning for x mins, x mile car journey, hours of tv, boiled kettles…
+ With calories, give % of daily requirements for an average adult man/woman (needed to compare nutritional value of different meals to evaluate quality of diet). (Later extension - protein? Carbs? Important nutritional groups rather than just calories?).
+ Add remove/edit buttons next to ingredients in the recipe list.
+ Change prompt when same ingredient is selected more than once.


####Long
+ Separate data array and prompt for liquids with quantities in ml? (Currently rely on people converting to g).
+ Add form to take recipe name
+ Need a more comprehensive list of foods, and consistent data set e.g. transport etc left out, or all data corresponding to the same country/region. Additional data needed:
+	a) co2 and cals per kg of foods for LOTS more ingredients
+	b) recipes (20 main, 20 lunch, 10 breakfast, 20 snacks, drinks?) and quantities
+ Add tabs for the 2 modes - meal detail and week/month detail
+ Design - look into drag and drop methods for ingredients, test. Need food and plate icons.
+ Decide best system to store info so calculations will work - separate into food groups to make searches faster? Would speed up array searches (when ingredient choice is longer) but need to include method to tell function which food arrays to search based on recipe contents.
+ Improve design. Make scrolling single page?


## Design plan
+ Two modes for 2 different levels of detail: 
+ 	a) Fine detail: Drag and drop ingredients from categorized menus on left onto empty plate icons on right. Name each plate. Add quantities to each ingredient. Can view multiple plates and compare emissions and nutritional values.
+ 	b) Bigger scale: Pre-designed meals with calculated emissions/values on left. Drag plates into meal calendar / table to create weekly diets with total emissions/values displayed. Can create different diets (with different names) to compare effect of e.g. removing red meat, removing dairy etc.


## Complications and subtleties to resolve
+ Portion sizes: for pre-designed meals, decide a standard portion size. Shouldn’t matter as long as size consistent as comparison is the aim.
+ Seasonal and location issues: Emissions associated with food types can be divided into production related and transport/storage related. Foods which can only be grown/produced in certain regions, or grow seasonally, will be flown in to others. This will make foodprints location and season dependent. Accounting for this would be ideal, but initially options are a) get production data only b) get data for one, consistent location (with the aim to allow location to be selected if data sets for different countries can be found). Later, either average transport-related emissions over a year to allow for standard changes in food sources with the seasons, or (data allowing) give option to select time of year and global or local only, to reflect personal shopping habits, where ingredients will disappear from the list should they not be available within the chosen radius from location.
